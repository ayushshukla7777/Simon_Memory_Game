About the Game-
1. The object of the game is to repeat a series of random tile clicks created by the game. After each round, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex which makes it harder to remember.

2. Youâ€™ll have four different tiles, each with a unique colour and sound which is activated when pressed. The sound aids the player in remembering the sequence and the game ends if the player misses a step in the sequence.


Remeber-
The sequence keep adding up ie. If in first level , you get  {green} then the answer pattern is {green} ; after that if in  second level ,you get a {red} then answer is {green,red}.
